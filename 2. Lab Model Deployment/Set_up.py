#1. Set up
'''
Before you use the sample code in this notebook, you must perform the following setup tasks:

    Create a Watson Studio Service.

    Create a Watson Machine Learning (WML) Service instance (a free plan is offered and information about how to create the instance is here).

    Create a Cloud Object Storage (COS) instance (a lite plan is offered and information about how to order storage is here).
    Note: When using Watson Studio, you already have a COS instance associated with the project you are running the notebook in.

    Create new credentials with HMAC:

        Go to Watson Studios, click the button on the top left corner.

        Select Data Services

        Go to your COS(Cloud Object Storage) dashboard.

        In the Service credentials tab, click New Credential+.

        Add the inline configuration parameter: {"HMAC":true}, click Add. (For more information, see HMAC.)

        This configuration parameter adds the following section to the instance credentials, (for use later in this notebook):

        "cos_hmac_keys": {
              "access_key_id": "-------",
              "secret_access_key": "-------"
         }

'''
#1.1 Work with Cloud Object Storage (COS)----------------------
'''
Install the boto library. This library allows Python developers to manage Cloud Object Storage (COS).

Tip: If ibm_boto3 is not preinstalled in you environment, run the following command to install it:
'''
# Run the command if ibm_boto3 is not installed.
!pip install ibm-cos-sdk

# Install the boto library.
import ibm_boto3
from ibm_botocore.client import Config

'''
Enter your COS credentials in the following cell.

You can find these credentials in your COS instance dashboard under the Service credentials tab.

Note: the HMAC key.

    To get your HMAC key:
        Go to Watson Studios, click the button on the top left corner.
        Select Data Services
        Go to your COS(Cloud Object Storage) dashboard.
        In the Service credentials click on View credentials (For more information, see HMAC.)
